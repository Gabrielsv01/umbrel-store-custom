  SteamOS (via Docker) allows you to run the Steam client in Big Picture mode directly in your browser.
  
  🚨 CRITICAL FIX (Run if Steam crashes/black screen):
  If Steam fails to open, you need to install DBus manually.
  Open the Terminal inside the browser (Right Click > Open Terminal) and run these 3 commands:
  
  1. Update system:
  sudo pacman -Sy
  
  2. Install DBus:
  sudo pacman -S dbus --noconfirm
  
  3. Start Steam:
  dbus-launch steam -no-sandbox
