  SteamOS (via Docker) allows you to run the Steam client in Big Picture mode directly in your browser.
  
  Turn your Umbrel into a gaming machine and stream games to any device.
  
  ⚠️ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Login with your Steam account.
  2. Go to Settings > Storage.
  3. Add the folder '/steam-library' as a drive. This maps directly to your Umbrel's 'Downloads/steam-games' folder.
  4. Set it as default to ensure games are saved to your Downloads folder.
  
  A controller connected via USB or Bluetooth is highly recommended.
